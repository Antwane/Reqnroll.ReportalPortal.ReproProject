# Reqnroll.ReportalPortal.ReproProject
Reproducing issue with Report Portal and Reqnroll. 

The following exception is found while trying to debug the default calculator tests

 Autofac.Core.Registration.ComponentNotRegisteredException : The requested service 'Reqnroll.FeatureContext' has not been registered. To avoid this exception, either register a component to provide the service, check for service registration using IsRegistered(), or use the ResolveOptional() method to resolve an optional dependency.
